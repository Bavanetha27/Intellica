Unlike traditional language models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG enhances responses by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external sources such as documents, databases, or web pages. This allows the system to generate answers that are more accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date.\n\nThe RAG architecture typically consists of two main components: a retriever and a generator. The retriever searches a large corpus to find passages or chunks relevant to the user query, while the generator, often a large language model, uses this retrieved information to produce coherent and informative response", "raw_path": "D:\\SIH2\\Intellica\\data\\uploads\\Retrieval.docx"}

By integrating retrieval with generation, RAG reduces hallucinations and improves factual correctness, making it effective for tasks requiring specialized or recent knowledge.\n\nOne of the main advantages of RAG is its ability to extend the modelâ€™s knowledge beyond what it learned during training. By accessing external data, RAG can provide up-to-date information and handle queries in specialized domains, such as healthcare, law, or enterprise knowledge management. Additionally, RAG can operate offline with locally stored documents, which enhances data privacy and reduces dependency on live", "raw_path": "D:\\SIH2\\Intellica\\data\\uploads\\Retrieval.docx"}
